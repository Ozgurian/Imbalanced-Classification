How to address imbalanced data

Resampling Techniques
===================

To tackle with imbalanced data entails strategies such as improving classification algorithms or balancing classes in the training data (data preprocessing) before providing the data as input to the machine learning algorithm. The later technique is preferred as it has wider application.

The main objective of balancing classes is to either increasing the frequency of the minority class or decreasing the frequency of the majority class. This is done in order to obtain approximately the same number of instances for both the classes. Let us look at a few resampling techniques:

* Random over-sampling:  increases the number of instances in the minority class by randomly replicating them in order to present a higher representation of the minority class in the sample.

* Random under-sampling
* Cluster-based oversampling
* Informed Over Sampling
* Modified synthetic minority oversampling technique (MSMOTE)
